                <h3>Summary of Debugging Methods Used:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Logging: Throughout the development process, logging statements were added to track the flow of execution, log variable values, and identify any unexpected behavior.</li>
                    <li>Testing: The code was tested in multiple browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility and to verify that it works as expected in different environments.</li>
                    <li>Error Handling: Exception handling was implemented using try-catch blocks to gracefully handle any errors that occur during form submission, ensuring a better user experience by displaying relevant error messages.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These debugging methods were essential in identifying and resolving issues throughout the development process, resulting in a functional and user-friendly form submission feature on the website.</p>

                <h2>Insight</h2>
                <p>In the client-side web development course, I've learned to build interactive and dynamic user experiences using HTML, CSS, 
                    and JavaScript. This involves creating engaging interfaces and functionality that run directly in the user's web 
                    browser without the need for server-side processing.</p>
                <p>Here are my completed projects for this course:</p>

                    <p>In this project, I created an application to convert temperature readings between Fahrenheit and Celsius, and vice
                        versa. I used the
                        provided formulas to perform the conversions:
                    
                        Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) / 1.8
                        Fahrenheit = Celsius Ã— 1.8 + 32
                        Users entered a temperature value in either Celsius or Fahrenheit, then pressed the Tab key to see the converted
                        temperature
                        in the other scale. The application automatically updated the temperature readings in real-time.</p>

                    <p>In this project, I generated an image gallery using images of the International Space Station. Each image was placed 
                        within a figure box accompanied by a caption taken from an array of caption text.</p>

                    <p>In this project, I was given a program that generated a random Jane Austen quote each time a page reloaded. The 
                        application called a function to generate a random integer used in picking the quote from an array of quotes.</p>

                    <p>In this project, I created an app that allowed users to rank photos by clicking the images in a 'photo bucket' 
                        to move them from the bucket to an ordered list of images. Clicking an image in the list returned the photo 
                        to the bucket while automatically renumbering the list</p>

                    <p>In this project, I programmed the actions of a sign-up form where users had to supply a username, email address, 
                        and password for a new account. Passwords had to be at least eight characters long and contain at least one 
                        letter and one number. As a validation test, users had to enter the password twice to confirm that they didn't 
                        mistype it. If the password didn't match the required pattern or if the two passwords weren't identical, the 
                        password field was flagged as invalid.</p>

                    <p>In this project, I generated a poker hand containing five cards randomly selected from a deck of cards. The 
                        names of the cards were stored in a text string that I converted into an array. To 'shuffle' the deck, I 
                        randomly sorted the array. Each time the user clicked a Deal button, the last five cards of the array were 
                        removed, reducing the size of the deck. When the size of the deck dropped to zero, a new randomly sorted deck 
                        was generated.</p>

                    <p>In this project, I worked on a web page where customers could attach greeting messages to gifts purchased for 
                        friends and family. The contents of the greeting message were entered on one web page form and then displayed 
                        as part of a shopping cart on a separate page. Data was transferred from one page to the next by appending data 
                        to a query string.</p>

                    <p>In this project, I used jQuery to add visual effects to a recipe page for the dessert website Save your Fork. Each 
                        recipe had an ingredients list and a list of directions. To save page space, both lists were initially hidden, but 
                        their contents could be revealed by clicking the Ingredients and Directions headings. When those headings were 
                        clicked, the lists toggled between sliding down to reveal their content and sliding up to hide it.</p>

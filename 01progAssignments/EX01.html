    <p>I am using VScode as my text editor to complete this assignment.</p>
    <p>Chapter 1 provides an overview of webpage design and all of the design 
    elements that must be taken into consideration when creating a webpage. 
    Before you begin coding a website, you first create a wire-frame and site 
    map. Next, you need to consider several design elements, such as graphics, 
    navigation, and color. Finally, you must also plan for accessibility.</p>
    <p>After reading Chapter 1, I now understand how to download and use a 
    text editor to create an HTML page. I know which HTML elements are required 
    to create a basic HTML webpage.</p>
